> Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC), has emerged as an effective

> characteristics, in which a linker joins a warhead binding to a
> protein of interest (POI), conferring specificity and a E3-ligand
> binding to an E3 ubiquitin ligase, this could trigger the
> ubiquitination and transportation of POI to the proteasome, followed
> by degradation. The rational PROTAC linker design is challenging due

> maintaining the binding mode of warhead and E3-ligand in the binding
> pockets of counterpart. Conventional linker generation method can only
> generate linkers in either 1D SMILES or 2D graph, without taking into
> account the information of ternary structures. Here we propose a novel
> 3D linker generative model PROTAC-INVENT which can not only generate
> SMILES of PROTAC but also its 3D putative binding conformation coupled
> with the target protein and the E3 ligase. The model is trained
> jointly with the RL approach to bias the generation of PROTAC
> structures toward pre-defined 2D and 3D based properties. Examples
> were provided to demonstrate the utility of the model for generating
> reasonable 3D conformation of PROTACs. On the other hand, our results
> show that the associated workflow for 3D PROTAC conformation

> **Model overview**

> PROTAC-INVENT takes a pair of fragment (E3-ligand and warhead for POI)
> and a reference PTS as input, and returns generated link-ers and the
> predicted binding conformations of the full PROTAC compounds in the
> binding site of reference PTS (as shown in Figure 1). T wo modules are
> integrated in PROTAC-INVENT. First, a generative model is trained to
> produce chemically feasible linker SMILES strings, following by
> forming complete PROTAC molecules together with the specified warhead
> and E3-ligand. REINVENT was used as the core generative engine for
> linker design and it was previously developed as an efficient
> generative model for *de novo* structure design. RL was utilized to
> search chemical space for optimization of molecular properties.
> Second, a 3D structure-based workflow was implemented to generate
> docking conforma-tions of PROTACs and provide scores accordingly. The

> Previously, Link-Invent was designed to generate PROTAC link-ers via
> RL, but their scoring function was based on purely 2D related metrics.
> Here we implemented a practical workflow to enable predicting 3D
> binding conformations of generated PROTAC molecules and score them by
> taking into account the structure information of a reference PTS. It
> takes four steps for the protocol to convert the SMILES of PROTAC to

> \(1\) Generate initial conformers of PROTAC in the vicinity of

>
> First of all, the SMILES of linker was generated by REINVENT prior
> model and then merged with the supplied warhead pair (as part of the
> input) to form the SMILES of full PROTAC. *Omega* \[32\] program was
> then utilized to convert SMILES to a set of initial 3D conformations.
> The 3D conformations were then super-imposed with the bound
> conformation of the reference PROTAC by using commercially available
> *ROCS* program \[33\]. The Com-boScore which is a weighted sum of
> shape and pharmacophore similarity was used to measure similarity
> between the reference conformer and the aligned conformation. Due to
> the large size of PROTAC, this superimposing is usually not able to
> create good alignment but still can serve the purpose of bringing the
> linker part of the PROTAC to the vicinity of the reference linker.
>
> \(2\) Merge the linker of PROTAC with the warheads of reference ligand
>
> Once the alignment was done, the warheads of the generated PROTAC were
> removed and only the linker atoms were remained. The warheads of
> reference ligand were then copied and merged with the linker fragment
> of the generated PROTAC to form a re-combined PROTAC conformation
> (RPC). After this operation, the coordinates of warhead atoms in the
> RPC were exactly the same to that of reference ligand, but the bond
> lengths, dihedral angles between terminal atoms of the linker and
> warheads were not corrected yet and need to be fixed.
>

> *Component for the number of aromatic ring*
>
> Studies have shown \[39, 40\] that multiple aromatic rings in linker
> of PROTAC molecules could be detrimental to the PK proper-ties of
> PROTACs. PROTAC-INVENT can customize the number of aromatic ring in
> the generated linker. Here, the default allowed number of aromatic
> ring is 1. If the number of aromatic ring of linker is less than or
> equal to the cut-off value, this score is 1.
>
> *Component of post-dock shape similarity* Otherwise, the score is 0.
>
> Another component, *Ps*, with a value in the range of \[0,1\], was set
> to measure the shape similarity between warheads (including the
> ligands for E3 ligase and POI) of docking conformation and that of the
> reference ligand. After 'local only' docking of DPC in the binding
> site of PTS, sometimes there is a large positional shift for the
> warheads of PROTACs comparing to the warheads of reference PROTAC. The
> larger the *Ps* value is, the more similar the warheads of PROTAC are
> to the reference. Here,*ROCS* was used to only calculate the shape
> similarity on site and no alignment optimization was done. For example
> in Figure 4, two PROTAC molecules *a* and *b* were generated by prior
> model. After docking procedure, the *Ps* scores of molecule *a* and
> *b* were 0.903 and 0.687, respectively, while their docking scores
> were roughly equal (ie. -11.37 versus â11.29). Clearly, in the docking
> poses, the warheads of molecule *a* had less deviation to those of
> reference ligand than molecule *b*.
>
> *Component for substructure alert*
>
> To clean the generated structures from generative model, a set of 24
> unwanted substructures (as shown in in supporting information) was
> defined. If the generated linker contains these substructures, the
> alert score is 0, otherwise the score is 1. The alert substructures
> can be user specified.
>
> *Component for linker length*
>
> The linker length is critical for maintaining proper conformation of
> PROTACs in PTS. PROTAC-INVENT can customize the range of linker length
> of PROTAC through a score component of linker
>
> **Computational details and datasets**
>
> REINVENT model was used as the core engine of PROTAC-INVENT to
> generate linkers in SMILES format. The relevant source code was mainly
> adapted from Link-INVENT \[29\], an extension of REINVENT model for
> linker design by Guo *et al*. Details should be referred to the
> original literature. In this work, the prior model of Link-INVENT was
> used as our prior model. This model was originally trained on a
> dataset processed from ChEMBL database, which comprises 10 313 109
> structure triplets which are formed as ('Warhead1 \| Warhead2, Linker,
> Full Molecule'). The processing details should be referred to the
> original paper \[29\]. During RL, the training epoch was set to 200
> and batch size was set to 100. Other parameters and high-parameters of
> training process can be found in supporting materials. In current
> study, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) PROTAC was chosen as the test
> case. Published PTS crystal structure 6W8I \[41\] was chosen as the
> reference structure for structure generation. For the diversity filter
> setting \[29, 31, 42, 43\] in the scoring function of RL, the
> 'IdenticalMurckoScaffold'option was used to increase the diversity of
> generated linkers. The'minscore' and 'minsimilarity' paremeters were
> all set as 0.0, so that all generated PROTACs during RL run will be
> kept.

> fluctuated in all models constrained with linker length, while the
> curves for production score (as shown in Figure 6a) behaved much
> better. In most of cases, the total score increased to around 0.8 in
> 50 epochs and can be stabilized more or less at the level for the rest
> of training. The results show that the training of production based

> of 14 PROTAC molecules were converted from SMILES by using the
> *LigPrep* module of *Schrodinger* and then docked into the complex
> structure composed by E3 ligase and POI. Initial 3D conformations of
> PROTAC in the workflow of PROTAC-INVENT were optimized by *ROCS*,
> which serves the purpose of bringing the generated PROTAC to the
> vicinity of the reference ligand. As a rule of thumb, initial
> conformation and starting pose of a compound will certainly affect the
> subsequent docking process (such as elapsed time, docking score
> *etc*). For making a fair comparison, we would like to eliminate the
> effect of the initial conformation on docking results. Therefore, in

> CONCLUSIONS
>
> In current work, a novel 3D linker generative model, PROTAC-INVENT,
> was proposed to rationally design PROTAC molecule. Previous analysis
> has shown that linker structure can largely affect the degradation
> efficacy of PROTAC molecules. So far, most of existing linker
> generation method of PROTAC can only design linker on either 1D SMILES
> or 2D graph level, which doesn't take into account the 3D information
> of the E3 ligase/POI complex structure. In PROTAC-INVENT model, the
> protein complex struc-tures were introduced and for the first time,
> the design of PROTAC linker was done at 3D level in which the 3D
> binding conformation PROTAC can be generated and the conformation of
> POI warhead
